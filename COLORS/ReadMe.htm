            </h2>
            <p align="justify">
              To run Colors!, you need a Nintendo DS and a flash card.<br/>
              <br/>
              Colors! works on all current Nintendo DSs (Original "Phat" DS, DS Lite, DSi, DS XL/LL) but pressure-sensitivity is only supported for the Original "Phat" DS and DS Lite.<br/>
              <br/>
              See the "Need help" section for an up-to-date list of what flash cards are supported.

              Installation
            </h2>
            <p align="justify">
              Most flash cards only require you to copy the Colors.nds (and the optional ColorsMagazine.col) file to your flash card. Some flash cards requires additional steps, so follow the instructions provided with your flash card on how to install and run homebrew.<br/>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p align="justify">
                  If you have trouble loading Colors.nds, try starting Colors! through the <a href="http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Homebrew_Menu">Homebrew Menu</a> (HBMenu.nds), included in the Colors! download. This helps with flash cards that are not fully homebrew compatible.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="justify">Make sure your flash card is using updated system software, available on the flash card manufacturer's website.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="justify">The Colors.ds.gba file is used for older flash cards who can't read the Colors.nds file.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="justify">
                  Some older flash cards might also require <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/">manual DLDI patching</a>.
